- User authentication and registration
- Job listing and search functionality
- Candidate profile creation and management

- System prompts with strict guardrails to ensure the LLM stays focused on job posting tasks only
- Enhanced job posting workflow to collect contact information
- Explicit rejection responses for off-topic queries
- Implemented a strict two-task limitation (job description crafting and job link parsing only)

## What's Left to Build
- Debug the chat interface to properly display responses from the Gemini API
- Implement error handling for API failures
- Add unit tests for the Gemini API integration
- Enhance the job posting workflow with more AI-powered features
- Implement analytics for job posting performance
- Add email notifications for job applications
- Test the guardrails to ensure they're effective
- Ensure the job posting workflow correctly collects contact information

## Current Status
- The application is functional with basic features working
- Google Gemini API integration is implemented and tested directly
- The official @google/genai package is integrated and working
- The chat interface for job posting needs debugging to display API responses
- The API key is configured and working correctly
- System prompts have been enhanced with strict guardrails to ensure the LLM stays focused on job posting tasks only

- Strict two-task limitation implemented (job description crafting and job link parsing only)

## Known Issues
- Chat interface not displaying responses from the Gemini API
- Limited error handling for API failures
- No unit tests for the Gemini API integration
