# Progress

This file tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, and known issues.

## What Works
- User authentication and registration
- Job listing and search functionality
- Candidate profile creation and management
- Job posting page with AI assistance (using Google Gemini API)
- Direct API integration with Google Gemini for job description generation
- Streaming API implementation for better response handling
- System prompts with strict guardrails to ensure the LLM stays focused on job posting tasks only
- Enhanced job posting workflow to collect contact information
- Explicit rejection responses for off-topic queries
- Implemented a strict two-task limitation (job description crafting and job link parsing only)
- Updated the route for FindJobsPage to /find-jobs to be more explicit
- Updated the header link to point to /find-jobs instead of /jobs
- Fixed text inconsistencies in HomePage.tsx (changed "Browse Find-Jobs" to "Browse Jobs", "Browse Evening Jobs", and "Browse Weekend Jobs")
- Fixed filter settings for job categories (Evening, Weekend, Summer)
- GitHub repository set up at https://github.com/growthpods/sb1-6kejut.git for version control
- RapidAPI Internships API integration for fetching Houston high school internships
- Database schema updated with source and career_site_url columns
- Weekly job script to fetch and store internships from RapidAPI
- Script to fetch and store RapidAPI internship results using Supabase MCP server

## What's Left to Build
- Debug the chat interface to properly display responses from the Gemini API
- Implement error handling for API failures
- Add unit tests for the Gemini API integration
- Enhance the job posting workflow with more AI-powered features
- Implement analytics for job posting performance
- Add email notifications for job applications
- Test the guardrails to ensure they're effective
- Ensure the job posting workflow correctly collects contact information
- Update all Supabase operations to use the MCP server instead of direct API calls

## Current Status
- The application is functional with basic features working
- Google Gemini API integration is implemented and tested directly
- The official @google/genai package is integrated and working
- The chat interface for job posting needs debugging to display API responses
- The API key is configured and working correctly
- System prompts have been enhanced with strict guardrails to ensure the LLM stays focused on job posting tasks only
- Job posting workflow has been updated to collect email or phone when no application URL is available
- Strict two-task limitation implemented (job description crafting and job link parsing only)
- Text inconsistencies in the UI have been fixed (replaced "Find-Jobs" with "Jobs" in button and link text)
- Filter settings for job categories (Evening, Weekend, Summer) now work correctly
- Changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub repository
- Decision made to use Supabase MCP server for all Supabase operations instead of direct API calls
- Created script to fetch and store RapidAPI internship results using Supabase MCP server
- Added npm script (fetch:rapidapi:mcp) to run the new MCP-based script

## Known Issues
- Chat interface not displaying responses from the Gemini API
- Limited error handling for API failures
- No unit tests for the Gemini API integration
- Browser console not showing detailed logs for debugging
