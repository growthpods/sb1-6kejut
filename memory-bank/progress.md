# Progress

This file tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, and known issues.

## What Works
- User authentication and registration
- Job listing and search functionality
- Candidate profile creation and management
- Job posting page with AI assistance (using Google Gemini API)
- Direct API integration with Google Gemini for job description generation
- Streaming API implementation for better response handling
- System prompts with strict guardrails to ensure the LLM stays focused on job posting tasks only
- Enhanced job posting workflow to collect contact information
- Explicit rejection responses for off-topic queries
- Implemented a strict two-task limitation (job description crafting and job link parsing only)
- Updated the route for FindJobsPage to /find-jobs to be more explicit
- Updated the header link to point to /find-jobs instead of /jobs
- Fixed text inconsistencies in HomePage.tsx (changed "Browse Find-Jobs" to "Browse Jobs", "Browse Evening Jobs", and "Browse Weekend Jobs")
- Fixed filter settings for job categories (Evening, Weekend, Summer)
- GitHub repository set up at https://github.com/growthpods/sb1-6kejut.git for version control
- RapidAPI Internships API integration for fetching internships (initial setup, including schema updates for `source` and `career_site_url`).
- Script (`scripts/fetchRapidApiInternshipsMCP.js`) and Netlify Function (`netlify/functions/fetch-daily-jobs.js`) updated to use `location_filter: 'Texas'` and mandatory "high school" keyword filters (`title_filter: '"high school" (intern OR internship OR "summer job")'`, `description_filter: '"high school" (student OR college OR intern)"'`). Both use `supabase-js` directly for database operations.
- Implemented automated daily job fetching from RapidAPI (defaulting to 'Texas' and mandatory "high school" filters), using a Netlify Scheduled Function (`netlify/functions/fetch-daily-jobs.js`). This function includes pagination and uses `supabase-js` directly for database interactions (deletions and upserts).
- The Netlify scheduled function includes logic to delete RapidAPI-sourced jobs older than 2 months from the database using `supabase-js`.
- Updated `.env` with the correct RapidAPI key and `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` (though the latter is not used by `supabase-js` client directly, it's good to have for other MCP interactions if any).
- Manually ran the updated job fetching script for Houston (returned 0 results in the most recent test after initial data load and deletion of old jobs, even with pagination and corrected filter).
- Configured `netlify.toml` for the scheduled Netlify function.
- Documented job sourcing mechanisms and the shift to `supabase-js` for this workflow in `systemPatterns.md` and `techContext.md`.
- Updated UI (`JobCard.tsx`, `JobDetailsPage.tsx`) to remove job source information from display, per user request.
- Updated `Job` type (`src/types/index.ts`) to include 'RapidAPI' as a source and add `careerSiteUrl` property (type update remains for data integrity).
- Successfully added a unique constraint (title, company, location) to the `jobs` table via migration `20250516192600_add_unique_constraint_jobs_title_company_location.sql`.
- Successfully fetched and upserted 49 internships from RapidAPI using the 'Houston' filter after applying the unique constraint. Total RapidAPI jobs in DB is now 67.
- Both `scripts/fetchRapidApiInternshipsMCP.js` and `netlify/functions/fetch-daily-jobs.js` now default to `location_filter: 'Texas'` and use mandatory "high school" keyword filters.

## What's Left to Build
- Debug the chat interface to properly display responses from the Gemini API.
- Implement error handling for API failures.
- Add unit tests for the Gemini API integration.
- Enhance the job posting workflow with more AI-powered features.
- Implement analytics for job posting performance.
- Add email notifications for job applications.
- Test the guardrails to ensure they're effective.
- Ensure the job posting workflow correctly collects contact information.
- Finalize and test the `supabase-js` database calls within the Netlify function `fetch-daily-jobs.js` (now filtering for 'Texas') in a deployed Netlify environment.
- Clarify and potentially implement dynamic location filtering for RapidAPI fetches (e.g., specific user city in Texas > Houston fallback > Texas default).
- Monitor daily Netlify scheduled function (fetching for 'Texas') for successful execution and job fetching.
- Review other parts of the application for consistency in Supabase interaction (MCP vs. direct `supabase-js`) and update if necessary.

## Current Status
- The application is functional with basic features working.
- Google Gemini API integration is implemented for job posting assistance.
- Automated daily fetching of internships from RapidAPI (now defaulting to `location_filter: 'Texas'` and mandatory "high school" filters with pagination) is set up via a Netlify Scheduled Function using `supabase-js` for database operations.
- Data retention policy (delete RapidAPI jobs >2 months old) is part of the scheduled function logic, implemented with `supabase-js`.
- The `scripts/fetchRapidApiInternshipsMCP.js` has been updated to default to `location_filter: 'Texas'` and mandatory "high school" filters (with pagination) and direct `supabase-js` database interaction.
- UI updated to remove job source information from `JobCard` and `JobDetailsPage` per user request.
- `.env` file updated with necessary API keys and Supabase credentials.
- Initial manual data load from RapidAPI (for general US) performed, and old jobs deletion tested.
- Updated `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `.env` file with the value provided by the user.
- Successfully applied migration `20250516192600_add_unique_constraint_jobs_title_company_location.sql` to enable `ON CONFLICT` for job upserts.
- Successfully ran `scripts/fetchRapidApiInternshipsMCP.js` with `location_filter: 'Houston'`, fetching 49 jobs and increasing the total count of RapidAPI-sourced jobs to 67.
- Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`) updated to reflect new automation and direct `supabase-js` usage for this workflow.
- UI improvements made to HomePage.tsx.

## Known Issues
- Chat interface not displaying responses from the Gemini API.
- Limited error handling for API failures.
- No unit tests for the Gemini API integration.
- Browser console not showing detailed logs for debugging.
- The Netlify function `fetch-daily-jobs.js` relies on environment variables (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `RAPIDAPI_INTERNSHIPS_KEY`, `RAPIDAPI_INTERNSHIPS_HOST`) being correctly set in the Netlify deployment environment for it to function.
